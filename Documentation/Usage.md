# Usage

There are many ways to use this library, but this is the way we use it.

Define a struct to hold all the fonts in your theme:

```swift
struct ThemeFont {
	var title1: UFont
	var title2: UFont
	[â€¦]
}
```

And now you can initialize it with the font hierarchy defined by your style guide.

If you are using SwiftUI, you can conform to EnvironmentKey so you can easily access your fonts in any view:

```swift
extension ThemeFont: EnvironmentKey {
	public static let defaultValue = ThemeFont()
}

extension EnvironmentValues {
	public var fonts: ThemeFont {
		get {
			return self[ThemeFont.self]
		}
		set {
			self[ThemeFont.self] = newValue
		}
	}
}

struct MyView: View {
	@Environment(\.fonts.title1.swiftUI) var font
	
	var body: some View {
		Text("Hello, World!").font(font)
	}
}
```
